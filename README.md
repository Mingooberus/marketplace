# Better Marketplace

This is an edit of the "Black Market" addon and PHP that complements the [Fallout: Incursion](https://github.com/KeithAlt/incursion-gamemode) gamemode and server template for [Nutscript 1.1](https://github.com/rebel1324/NutScript#nutscript-11)

The Marketplace is designed for FalloutRP UI wise, thus it's derma and keyphrases will come pre-configured as such. The Marketplace allows for players on a server to put items that they have in their inventory onto a public list which they set a price and if applicable quantity. Other players then can access The Marketplace by pressing their use key on the physical machine model wherever they are setup and buy said items. 

This contains proprietary code by [@yobson1](https://github.com/yobson1) annotated with several older names such as "Jonjo" however the php code has been rewritten from the ground-up to prevent potential injections and exploits from occurring.
